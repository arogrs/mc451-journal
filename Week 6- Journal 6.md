## Your Reflection

[I relate to that mid project paralysis where I've read so many articles and gathered a lot of information to the point where what I'm working on feels like too much or not enough. There has been times where I didnt know what to do with all the information I had in front of me and I felt overwhelmed but this chapter taught me that I need to strengthen my narrowing. The idea of scope creep really stuck out to me too. It's easy for someone to want to study a topic that feels exciting and important to them but the chapter made it clear that something being exciting to us does mean its the same as a viable research design. The narrowing funnel example showed me how to be more specific which would help me manage all my information. Instead of trying to study everything, I should choose a clear time frame, a specific group, and a defined theory. Doing this would help make my project stronger. I've also been reminded that everything has to align. A theory sounding "impressive" isn't enough. It has to match my data. The theory should explain what I'm measuring and the data should help answer my research question. Thinking about things aligning gives me a way to check if my project is actually making sense. I also liked the explanation of exploratory, descriptive, and explanatory research. Sometimes I get too excited and try to do all three at once. I was under the impression that I had to explore patterns, describe trends, and explain why things happen all in one project. But this chapter showed me that I dont have to do everything. I just need to be clear about my main goal.]
