# Week 3: [Journal 3]

**Date:** [January 27, 2026]
**Phase:** [Journalist / Architect / Translator / Analyst / Publisher]
**Approach Used:** [Connector]

## Your Reflection

[This reading connects to what I'm working on because it addresses a problem I've already experienced which is feeling overwhelmed by sources without having a system to manage them. Whenever I'm researching, I find it is so easy to fall into the trap of opening multiple tabs, reading without comprehending, highlighting sections, and then having a hard time remembering how everything fits together. The idea that the issue isn't stemming from a lack of information but really a lack of system or workflow that resonates with me and also helps me. I'm working with multiple studies and without a method thats structured like Obsidian and organized collections in Zotero I can see how I could end up focusing on each article individually instead of connecting them all together. My final project doesnt need me to report what each study/ article found. It will ask me to call out patterns across my articles and connect them so I can argue for a broader interpretation. The strategic reading order (abstract to conclusion to introduction to methods to results) connects to my workflow. I know that not every article with be as useful as the last but this approach will help me fastly determine which article is truly useful to me and which article isnt. That approach helps me quickly determine relevance and figure out which article is worth putting my time in to.]
