## Your Reflection

[This week, the most difficult challenge I faced was unexpectedly losing access to my MacBook when it randomly went into recovery assist mode. Of course this happening is inconvenient but because my only class this semester is MC451, a course that relies heavily on computer access, it immediately became stressful. I didn't notice what my laptop was doing until a hour before class, which put a lot of pressure on me because I knew we were gonna be doing things on our computers. I first went to SIUE's ITS department thinking they would be able to get it back up and running but they explained to me that they only handle minor technical problems and said I should take my MacBook to either Geek Squad at Best Buy or an Apple Store to have one of their reps look at it. The employee at Best Buy explained that it would cost me around $200 just to diagnose the issue and possibly another $200 to fix it. He guessed that my MacBook must have gotten stuck during a system update and rebooted itself into recovery mode. Hearing how much it could cost to have it "fixed" made me shortly consider trading in my MacBook and buying a new one. That idea started to feel extreme and unnecessary but at the time I was just in a rush to get back to having a productive MacBook. When I got back to my apartment I decided to contact Apple Support directly instead of making a drive all the way to the Galleria. The rep knew what I was talking about as soon as I explained the situation. She told me to hold down on the power button until the "options" button appeared and it worked immediately. Looking back, this experience reminded me how much I depend on technology and how quickly something small can disrupt my routine. I've also realized that if this was the hardest part of my week, then I'm fortunate to have a relatively simple life.]
