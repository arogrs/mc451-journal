**Approach Used:** [Critic]

## Your Reflection

[My question is can reproducible research become standard without major changes to access to resources or will it remain difficult for many to reach? This chapter explained that using reproducible workflows is beneficial for other researchers. The benefits are obvious but I thought about how this idea kind of ignores the barriers that stop reproducibility from becoming common practice. The chapter pushes us to work at Level 4 but we do not control academic norms. I feel like if the academic norms don't change then reproducibility might only be something taught in classes instead of something widely practiced in real research. Another concern I have is access. Learning R, Git, and the other applications we use isn't hard and it takes playing around on it with a good computer and reliable internet to really understand it. It makes me think about students at underfunded schools or in poorer countries that possibly don't have access to those resources. Version control with GitHub needs stable internet access. Rendering documents, downloading packages, and updating environments all depend on having a good connection. In some places, internet is slow, expensive, or unreliable, which could turn something that is a simple task to us into an obstacle. If reproducibility is expected to become to new norm then it could, unintentionally, be a disadvantage for people who have the potential to be researchers but don't have the training or resources needed. ]
