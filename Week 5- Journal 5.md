# Week 5: Journal 5]

**Date:** [February 16, 2026]
**Phase:** [Journalist / Architect / Translator / Analyst / Publisher]
**Approach Used:** [Connector]

## Your Reflection

[This week's reading connects to what I'm working on because it forces me to move from only identifying patterns to actually explaining them. I think research forces you to think a lot about relationships and how different things connect to each other but this chapter has showed me that identifying a correlation isn't enough. I need to figure out and study why that relationship exists in the first place. For example, lets say I find that songs with negative lyrics chart higher. I could say that listeners look for emotionally intense music to fulfill their specific needs, like validation. Another theory might suggest that certain emotional tones signal authenticity or identity within genre communities which strengthens group bonds. Each lens would help me develop my explanation for my findings. This chapter taught me how to be intentional. The theory I choose will determine what I measure, what hypothesis I come up with, and how I justify my conclusions.]
