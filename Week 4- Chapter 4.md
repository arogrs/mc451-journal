**Approach Used:** [Critic]

## Your Reflection

[The question that this chapter left me asking was "How do I know when I've read enough?" The chapter offers clear indicators (repeated citations of the same foundational studies, predictable findings) but I've always thought that good research comes from reading everything that is available to me. I've also always thought that if I'm not overwhelmed with the information I'm finding then maybe I havent gone deep enough. This chapter changed my mindset, making me think that depth comes from calling out patterns and not having multiple PDFs in front of me. The idea that literature reviews is an argument and not a summary also intrigued me. I'm not just reporting what others have previously said or found about the topic I'm researching but about how all the pieces fit together. To me that doesn't sound easy. I have a hard time putting my own thoughts together so imagine how I feel trying to put other people's thoughts together. If I find two studies that contradict each other, I can't just put those under two different columns and then move on. I have to study the contradictions and maybe find my own study as a response to it. Research is starting to feel less like a personal curiosity and more like entering a very serious intellectual conversation.]
